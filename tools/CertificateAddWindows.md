# Add Certificate (Windows)

To be access your visual through PowerBI you need to add a trusted certificate for localhost. This will allow PowerBI to load the visual assets in your browser without a security warning.

----------

## Step 1

Run the following command to open the certificate and start the process.

```
pbiviz --install-cert
```

*If this command fails for some reason find pbiviz in your global node modules folder and open the certificate manually.*
