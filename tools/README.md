## Server certificate setup

To enable live preview visual assets need to be served on a trusted https server so before you can start you need to install an ssl certificate which will allow visual asssets to load in your web browser. This is a one time setup.

## Enable developer visual

To view/test your visual in PowerBI you need to enable the development visual and then you can add it to any report.
