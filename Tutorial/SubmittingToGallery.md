## Submission flow

1. Author submits a visual package and content.
2. The Microsoft custom visuals team reviews the visual and contents and provides a written report to the author identifying blocking and non-blocking issues.
3. Author corrects any issues and re-submits the visual package.
4. Once all blocking issues have been resolved, author provides a sample report, blog post and video highlighting the features and functions of the visual.
5. Microsoft publishes the visual to the Power BI visual gallery.

> ***NOTE:** once published to the gallery, the custom visual goes through deployment rings to ensure the quality of the visual by exposing it to a limited set of users that gradually goes wider as the visuals goes through the different rings. It will take about 3 weeks for the custom visual to appear in the public gallery, if there was no breaking change detected in any of the deployment rings.

### Submission tracking

The custom visuals team will contact you for the status of your visual submission. The team will provide you with feedback on the visual, blocking issues which will prevent the visual from being published, requests for any missing content, notification when your visual is ready to publish, and when the visual publication is complete.

## Support for custom visuals

Microsoft’s goal for the Power BI visuals gallery is to have high-quality visuals to provide a rich user reporting experience. From time to time, we are notified that a visual in the gallery is not working properly or at all.
Microsoft reserves the right to fix visuals from the community to ensure a good user experience. If we make such fix to a visual you have published, we will provide you with all coding changes so that they may be included in your next version release.
