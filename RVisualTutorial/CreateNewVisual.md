# Building a new R Powered Custom Visual
In order to create a new R Powered Custom Visual we will run the following command:

```
pbiviz new sampleCorrPlotRVisual -t rvisual
```

This command will create a new folder stracture based on the template `rvisual`

This template includes a very basic ready to run R Visual which will actually run the following R script:

```r
plot(Values)
```

This R script calls a generic function for plotting of R object. The data frame "Values" will contian columns in "Values" data role.
